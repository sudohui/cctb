They often rely on basic statistics like item frequency and offer the same suggestions to all users, focusing on what is popular among the majority.\n",

It can be user-based, where recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users, or item-based, where recommendations are made based on items that are similar to what the user has liked in the past.\n"
